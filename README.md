# Robot-Dynamics

#Please give the Home configuration, twists and joint variables of the 
 manipulator.
#The Matlab code calculates forward kinematics and return robots final pose,
 calculate jacobian of the robot at that particular pose, Do singularity 
 analysis.
#Please give the static torque acting at the end effector to view torques 
 acting at each joints in a static position.
#Please give desired manipulator pose to calculate inverse kinematics and return the joint variables required to reach that final pose.
